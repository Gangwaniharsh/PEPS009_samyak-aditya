# Weather App 🌤️

**Goal:** Build a real-world app that fetches weather data based on user input.

## 📝 Concepts Covered
- API Calls (OpenWeatherMap or similar)
- Async/Await
- Template Literals
- Event Listeners
- Error Handling

## 🎯 Task
1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) (or use a mock URL provided in script).
2. Create an async function `getWeather(city)`.
3. Fetch data dynamically when user types a city and clicks search.
4. Update the DOM with Temperature, Description, and an Icon.

## 🚀 Bonus
- Change background color based on temperature (Warm/Cold).
